    Parameters
    ----------
    destination : str, optional
        Path to download the test example files to. The default
        is ``None``, in which case the default path for app data
        is used.
    force : bool, optional
        Whether to always download the test example files. The default is
        ``False``, in which case if the test example files are cached, they
        are reused.

    Returns
    -------
    List[str]
        Local paths to the downloaded test example files.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import ansys.meshing.prime as prime
    >>> import ansys.meshing.prime.examples as prime_examples
    >>> with prime.launch_prime() as session:
