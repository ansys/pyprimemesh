Connections

===================
Zonelet Connection
===================

The :class:`Connect <ansys.meshing.prime.Connect>` class allows you to connect the face zonelets in a part, volume, or model using various connect algorithms.
The three major operations for Zonelet Connection are Intersect, Stitch and Join. You'd normally need to create a conformally connected surface mesh using join/intersect operations before generating the volume mesh. 

 - :func:`Connect.intersect_face_zonelets() <ansys.meshing.prime.Connect.intersect_face_zonelets>`: Allows you to intersect the face zonelets of the part along the intersecting faces. 

 - :func:`Connect.stitch_face_zonelets() <ansys.meshing.prime.Connect.stitch_face_zonelets>`: Allows you to stitch a set of face zonelets to another set of face zonelets along the boundary of zonelets. 

 - :func:`Connect.join_face_zonelets() <ansys.meshing.prime.Connect.stitch_face_zonelets>`: Allows you to join a set of face zonelets to another set of face zonelets along the overlapping faces. 


.. note::
    Connect operations support only computational mesh (mesh with reasonable size). Faceted geometry is not supported. 


==========================
Topology Based Connection
==========================

The :class:`Scaffolder <ansys.meshing.prime.Scaffolder>` class allows you to provide connection using faceted geometry and topology, handling the gaps and mismatches in the geometry.
Topology based connection creates conformal meshes on shared topologies to provide a better connection between the topofaces.

.. note::
    Connectivity cannot be shared across multiple parts.
