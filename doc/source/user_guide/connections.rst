Connections

==================
Zonelet connection
==================

Connect operations help you to create a watertight, fully connected surface mesh for successful volume mesh generation.
Connect operations conformally connect multiple watertight volumes providing shared zonelets (and therefore connected
volume mesh) between them. The :class:`Connect <ansys.meshing.prime.Connect>` class allows you to connect the face zonelets
in a part, volume, or model using various connect algorithms.

There are three major operations for zonelet connections: 

- The :func:`Connect.intersect_face_zonelets() <ansys.meshing.prime.Connect.intersect_face_zonelets>` method allows you
  to intersect the face zonelets of the part along the intersecting faces. 

- The :func:`Connect.stitch_face_zonelets() <ansys.meshing.prime.Connect.stitch_face_zonelets>` method allows you to
  stitch a set of face zonelets to another set of face zonelets along the boundary of zonelets. 

- The :func:`Connect.join_face_zonelets() <ansys.meshing.prime.Connect.join_face_zonelets>` method allows you to join
  a set of face zonelets to another set of face zonelets along the overlapping faces. 


.. note::
    Connect operations support only computational mesh, which is mesh with reasonable size changes and quality.
    Faceted geometry, which is STL-like mesh that can have extreme size changes and many sliver elements, is not supported.


The following example shows how to accomplish these tasks:

* Import the model and delete geometry topology from each part.
* Merge the parts and check the surface mesh connectivity.
* Perform the join or intersect operation on face zonelets.

#. Import the model and delete topo-geometric entities from each part:

   .. code-block:: python

       prime.FileIO(model).read_pmdat(
           "D:/Temp/mesh.pmdat", file_read_params=prime.FileReadParams(model)
       )
       for part in model.parts:
           topofaces = part.get_topo_faces()
           if topofaces:
               params = prime.DeleteTopoEntitiesParams(
                   model, delete_geom_zonelets=True, delete_mesh_zonelets=False
               )
               part.delete_topo_entities(params)


#. Merge the parts.

   .. code-block:: python

       model.merge_parts(
           part_ids=[part.id for part in model.parts], params=prime.MergePartsParams(model)
       )

#. Check the surface before performing the connect operation.

   .. code-block:: python

       diag = prime.SurfaceSearch(model)
       diag_res = diag.get_surface_diagnostic_summary(
           prime.SurfaceDiagnosticSummaryParams(
               model,
               scope=prime.ScopeDefinition(model=model, part_expression="*"),
               compute_free_edges=True,
               compute_multi_edges=True,
           )
       )


   For more information on checking the surface mesh connectivity, see :ref:`ref_index_mesh_diagnostics`.

#. Print the results of the surface mesh connectivity before performing the connect operation:

   .. code-block:: pycon

       >>> print(diag_res)

       error_code :  ErrorCode.NOERROR
       n_self_intersections :  342
       n_free_edges :  564
       n_multi_edges :  0
       n_duplicate_faces :  0


#. Connect face zonelets in the model:

   .. note::
      Only triangular faces are supported.

   .. code-block:: python

       join_params = prime.JoinParams(model)
       inter_params = prime.IntersectParams(model)
       join_params.tolerance = 0.1
       part_id = model.parts[0].id
       faces = model.parts[0].get_face_zonelets()

       for face in faces:
           other_faces = [other for other in faces if face != other]
           prime.Connect(model).intersect_face_zonelets(
               part_id=part_id,
               face_zonelet_ids=[face],
               with_face_zonelet_ids=other_faces,
               params=inter_params,
           )
           prime.Connect(model).join_face_zonelets(
               part_id=part_id,
               face_zonelet_ids=[face],
               with_face_zonelet_ids=other_faces,
               params=join_params,
           )


#. Check the surface after performing the connect operation:

   .. code-block:: python

       diag_res = diag.get_surface_diagnostic_summary(diag_params)


#. Print the results of the surface mesh connectivity after performing the connect operation:

   .. code-block:: pycon

       >>> print(diag_res)

       error_code :  ErrorCode.NOERROR
       n_self_intersections :  0
       n_free_edges :  448
       n_multi_edges :  9
       n_duplicate_faces :  0


=========================
Topology-based connection
=========================

The :class:`Scaffolder <ansys.meshing.prime.Scaffolder>` class allows you to provide connection
using faceted geometry and topology. This class also handles the gaps and mismatches in the geometry.

Topology-based connection creates shared topoedges between neighbouring topofaces. Hence, you can
create connected mesh between topofaces.

.. note::
  Connectivity cannot be shared across multiple parts.

This code merges parts and scaffold topofaces:

.. code-block:: python

    # Merge parts
    model.merge_parts(
        part_ids=[part.id for part in model.parts], params=prime.MergePartsParams(model)
    )

    # Scaffold topofaces
    params = prime.ScaffolderParams(
        model=model,
        absolute_dist_tol=0.01,
        intersection_control_mask=prime.IntersectionMask.FACEFACEANDEDGEEDGE,
        constant_mesh_size=0.1,
    )

    scaffolder = prime.Scaffolder(model, part.id)
    res = scaffolder.scaffold_topo_faces_and_beams(
        topo_faces=part.get_topo_faces(), topo_beams=[], params=params
    )

This code prints the results so that you can check the number of topofaces that failed
in the scaffold operation:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> print(res)

    n_incomplete_topo_faces :  0
    error_code :  ErrorCode.NOERROR
