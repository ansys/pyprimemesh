Getting Started
===============

The PyPrimeMesh project supports a python client for Ansys Prime Server
that provides core Ansys meshing technology.

To use PyPrimeMesh, you must have a local installation of Ansys. The
version of Ansys installed dictates the features available to you.

For more information on getting a licensed copy of Ansys, visit
`Ansys <ansys>`.

Installation
------------

The ``ansys-meshing-prime`` package currently supports Python 3.7
to Python 3.9 on Windows and Linux operating systems.

PyPrimeMesh can be installed directly from PyPi as follows:

.. code::

   pip install ansys-meshing-prime

.. note::
   PyPrimeMesh is not available on PyPi at present.

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install the client using

.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/pyansys/pyprimemesh
   cd pyprimemesh
   pip install -e .

The above command will only install basic version of the client. This will not
include some functionality that is important to development. To install
everything useful in development, use the following command instead.

.. code::

    pip install -e .[all]

Dependencies
------------

You must have a licensed copy of the latest version of Ansys 2023 R1 locally.

Launching PyPrimeMesh
---------------------

To launch PyPrimeMesh:

.. code::

   import ansys.meshing.prime as prime
   with prime.launch_prime() as prime_client:
   	model = prime_client.model
