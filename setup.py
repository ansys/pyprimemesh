"""PyPrimeMesh provides pythonic access to Prime server present in the Ansys Workbench install.

PyPrimeMesh is an integral part of PyAnsys effort to facilitate the use of Ansys technologies
directly from Python. PyPrimeMesh consists of various python modules that help you to acquire
geometry and generate surface and volume meshes for multiple solvers.

PyPrimeMesh enables you to:

* Generate quad dominant and triangular surface meshes
* Generate surface meshes with various sizing options like volumetric, constant, and so on
* Generate volume meshes with linear and quadratic elements of various shapes like tetrahedra,
  hexahedra, pyramids, prisms
* Generate volume meshes with single process or distributed process
* Check mesh quality to provide the best solution for the problem and improve predictive
  capabilities
* Perform mesh diagnostics for free, multi-connected edges, self-intersection and overlapping faces
  in the model
* Modularize meshing algorithms, components, and services for easier reuse in other applications
* Expose micro services and APIs for meshing operations to promote meshing workflow prototyping
