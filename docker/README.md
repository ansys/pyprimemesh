Create your own Ansys Prime Server Docker container
===================================================

To learn how to build your own Ansys Server Docker container, see 
[Guide to building the Linux Docker container](https://prime.docs.pyansys.com/version/dev/getting_started/index.html).

If you have your own Ansys installation, you can build a Docker container that uses your installation.

To do this, download the Python script [build_docker_linux.py](https://github.com/ansys/pyprimemesh/blob/main/docker/build_docker_linux.py) and run it from the command line:

```python
python build_docker_linux.py
```
If you have any problems, open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ansys/pyprimemesh/issues).
