.. _ref_how_to_add_an_example_reference_key:

Adding a new example
--------------------
**Summary**: This example demonstrates how to add new examples and serves as a template
that you can use in their creation.

A block comment must be included at the top of any new example. Each example
must have a reference tag in this format:

``.. _ref_my_example:``

The ``.. _ref_`` is necessary. Everything that follows is your reference tag.
Keep all references in `snake case`.

This section should give a brief overview of what the example is about and/or demonstrates.
The title should be changed to reflect the topic your example covers.

New examples should be added as Python scripts to:

``pyprimemesh/examples/gallery``

.. note::
   Avoid creating new folders unless absolutely necessary. If in doubt, put the example
   in the folder closest to what it is doing and its precise location can be advised
   on in the pull request. If you *must* create a new folder, make sure to add a
   ``README.txt`` file containing a reference, a title, and a single sentence describing the folder.
   Otherwise, the new folder is ignored by Sphinx.

Example file names should be in the format:

``example_name.py``

.. note::
    Supporting input files for the example, such as CAD or mesh file assets, must be either original
    content or have appropriate licensing and ownership permissions from their respective owners. If
    the input files are used within the example script provided they must be capable of running in
    the CI pipeline. This means that only files that can be read using the native file formats and
    CAD readers can be used in the scripted examples.

The recommended data formats to be included in the example are:

* .pmdat
* .fmd
* .scdoc or .dsco (supported on Windows OS)

Supporting input files should be added in:

`Github Example Data Repository <https://github.com/pyansys/example-data/tree/master/pyprimemesh>`_

Referencing files as enum and creating download function in:

``pyprimemesh/examples.py``

Also adding download function to:

``pyprimemesh/examples/__init__.py``

After this preamble is the first code block:
"""

import ansys.meshing.prime as prime
from ansys.meshing.prime.graphics import Graphics

# Start Ansys Prime Server instance and get client model
prime_client = prime.launch_prime()
model = prime_client.model

# Your code goes here...
mesh_util = prime.lucid.Mesh(model=model)

# For Windows OS users scdoc is also available:
# mixing_elbow = prime.examples.download_elbow_scdoc()
mixing_elbow = prime.examples.download_elbow_fmd()
mesh_util.read(mixing_elbow)
print(model)

# Create sections
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# You can break up code blocks in titled sections that provide descriptive text.
# When Sphinx is used to generate the documentation, this content is interpreted
# as ReStructured Text (RST).
#
# .. note::
# You only need to create the Python (PY) files for the example. The
# ``sphinx-gallery`` extension automatically generates the Jupyter
# notebook, the HTML files for the documentation, and the demo script.
#
# Sections can contain any information that you may have regarding the example,
# such as step-by-step comments and information on motivations. In the generated
# Jupyter notebook, this text is translated into a markdown cell.
#
# As in Jupyter notebooks, if code is left unassigned at the end of a code block
# (as with ``model`` in the previous block), the output is generated and
# printed to the screen according to its ``__repr__``.  Otherwise, you can use
# ``print()`` to output the ``__str__``.

# more code...
mesh_util.surface_mesh(min_size=5, max_size=20)
mesh_util.volume_mesh(
    volume_fill_type=prime.VolumeFillType.POLY,
    prism_surface_expression="* !inlet !outlet",
    prism_layers=3,
)

###############################################################################
# Render graphics
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# If you display graphics, the result is auto-generated and
# rendered on the page:
display = Graphics(model)
display()

###############################################################################
# Make a pull request
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Once your example is complete and you've verified builds locally, you can make a
# pull request (PR).  Branches containing examples should be prefixed with `doc/`
# as per the branch-naming conventions found in the :ref:`ref_index_contributing`
# topic in the *PyAnsys Developer's Guide*.
