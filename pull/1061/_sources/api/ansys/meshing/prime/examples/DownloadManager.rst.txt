Method detail

.. py:method:: add_file(file_path: str)

   Add the path for a downloaded example file to a list.

   This list keeps track of where example files are
   downloaded so that a global cleanup of these files can be
   performed when the client is closed.

   :param file_path: Local path of the downloaded example file.
   :type file_path: str


.. py:method:: clear_download_cache()

   Remove downloaded example files from the local path.


.. py:method:: download_file(filename: str, *directory: str, destination: Optional[str] = None, force: bool = False) -> str

   Download an example file from the PyPrimeMesh repository.

   :param filename: Name of the example file to download.
   :type filename: str
   :param destination: Path to download the example file to. The default
                       is ``None``, in which case the default path for app data
                       is used.
   :type destination: str, optional
   :param force: Whether to always download the example file. The default is
                 ``False``, in which case if the example file is cached, it
                 is reused.
   :type force: bool, optional
   :param directory: Path under the PyAnsys Github examples repository.
   :type directory: tuple[str]

   :returns: Tuple containing the filepath to use and the local filepath of the downloaded
             directory. The two are different in case of containers.
   :rtype: tuple[str, str]
