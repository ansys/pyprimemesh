===========================


.. py:class:: ansys.meshing.prime.autogen.commontypes.CellQualityMeasure

          * - :py:attr:`~ASPECTRATIO`
            - The Aspect Ratio metric is greater than 1. A value of 1 indicates an equilateral cell (best) and a value of 20(e.g) indicates a stretched cell (worst).
          * - :py:attr:`~ELEMENTQUALITY`
            - The Element Quality metric ranges between 0 (worst) and 1 (best). A value of 1 indicates a perfect cube or square (best) while a value of 0 indicates that the element has a zero or negative volume (worst).
          * - :py:attr:`~FLUENTASPECTRATIO`
            - The Fluent aspect Ratio metric is greater than 1. A value of 1 indicates an equilateral cell (best) and a value of 20(e.g) indicates a stretched cell (worst).
          * - :py:attr:`~INVERSEORTHOGONAL`
            - The inverse orthogonal metric ranges between 0 (best) and 1 (worst).
          * - :py:attr:`~INVERSEORTHOGONAL_V2`
            - The advanced inverse orthogonal metric ranges between 0 (best) and 1 (worst).
          * - :py:attr:`~SKEWNESS`
            - The Skewness metric ranges between 0 (best) and 1 (worst). A value of 0 indicates an equilateral cell (best) and a value of 1 indicates a completely degenerate cell (worst).

Attribute detail
----------------

.. py:attribute:: ASPECTRATIO
   :value: 5


   The Aspect Ratio metric is greater than 1. A value of 1 indicates an equilateral cell (best) and a value of 20(e.g) indicates a stretched cell (worst).

.. py:attribute:: ELEMENTQUALITY
   :value: 50


   The Element Quality metric ranges between 0 (worst) and 1 (best). A value of 1 indicates a perfect cube or square (best) while a value of 0 indicates that the element has a zero or negative volume (worst).

.. py:attribute:: FLUENTASPECTRATIO
   :value: 13


   The Fluent aspect Ratio metric is greater than 1. A value of 1 indicates an equilateral cell (best) and a value of 20(e.g) indicates a stretched cell (worst).

.. py:attribute:: INVERSEORTHOGONAL
   :value: 14


   The inverse orthogonal metric ranges between 0 (best) and 1 (worst).

.. py:attribute:: INVERSEORTHOGONAL_V2
   :value: 25


   The advanced inverse orthogonal metric ranges between 0 (best) and 1 (worst).

.. py:attribute:: SKEWNESS
   :value: 0


   The Skewness metric ranges between 0 (best) and 1 (worst). A value of 0 indicates an equilateral cell (best) and a value of 1 indicates a completely degenerate cell (worst).
