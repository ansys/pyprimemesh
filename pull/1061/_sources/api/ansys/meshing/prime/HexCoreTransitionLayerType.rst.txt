          * - :py:attr:`~DELETEBOTH`
            - Remove neighboring hexes of different size by deleting both smaller and larger cell layers. The voids are filled with tetrahedral or polyhedral cells depending on volumeFillType in AutoMeshParams structure.
          * - :py:attr:`~DELETELARGE`
            - Remove neighboring hexes of different size by deleting a layer of larger cells. The voids are filled with tetrahedral or polyhedral cells depending on volumeFillType in AutoMeshParams structure.
          * - :py:attr:`~DELETESMALL`
            - Remove neighboring hexes of different size by deleting a layer of smaller cells. The voids are filled with tetrahedral or polyhedral cells depending on volumeFillType in AutoMeshParams structure.
          * - :py:attr:`~HANGINGNODES`
            - Allow different size hexes to be neighbors.

Attribute detail
----------------

.. py:attribute:: DELETEBOTH
   :value: 3


   Remove neighboring hexes of different size by deleting both smaller and larger cell layers. The voids are filled with tetrahedral or polyhedral cells depending on volumeFillType in AutoMeshParams structure.

.. py:attribute:: DELETELARGE
   :value: 2


   Remove neighboring hexes of different size by deleting a layer of larger cells. The voids are filled with tetrahedral or polyhedral cells depending on volumeFillType in AutoMeshParams structure.

.. py:attribute:: DELETESMALL
   :value: 1


   Remove neighboring hexes of different size by deleting a layer of smaller cells. The voids are filled with tetrahedral or polyhedral cells depending on volumeFillType in AutoMeshParams structure.

.. py:attribute:: HANGINGNODES
   :value: 0


   Allow different size hexes to be neighbors.
